Wordpress, without the fat.

== Description ==

= Preamble =

You make web sites and you love Wordpress to the death. Someone (say, Joe) is asking you to do a web site of a few pages, and you want to use Wordpress so that Joe can maintain the web site by himself.

The problem is, Wordpress looks too complicated for Joe, and anyway, Joe wouldn't need all the junk that Wordpress has to offer.

= WPlite to the rescue =

WPlite ("Wordpress lite") is a Wordpress plugin that lets you hide 'unnecessary' items from the Wordpress administration menu---even the Dashboard. On top of that, you can also hide post meta controls on the Write page, so as to simplify the editing interface.

The result: a minimal, Zen-like Wordpress administration area.

== Installation ==

Easy as 1-2-3.

1. Upload `wplite.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the plugin at Options -> WPlite
